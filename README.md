# Object-Detection-and-Identification-for-blinds
The proposed system will help the blind person to identify different object from surrounding and give voice feedback to them, so that they can easily understand what exactly the object is without taking help from others. The device include Raspberri pi module along with raspberri pi camera module and spealer or earphones for voice assitance. The camera will capture the real time images from surroundings. We have used MobileNet SSD (Single shot detector) algorithm for object detection and identification. SSD divides the input images using grid cell. Grid cell are responsible for detection of object within grid cell. Detection of object simply means predicting classes and location within images. If no object is present it will consider as background or simply ignores. Grid cells are assign with multiple anchor boxes. Anchor boxes are responsible for size and shape within grid cell. This anchor boxes are assigned with aspect ratio, as not all objects are square shape. Some are longer some are wider. So ssd provides predefined anchor boxes. Respective field defines different size of images. It goes deeper and deeper apply convolutions and finally detect different object from images. The detected objects are identify using classes which are define in dataset. We have used gtts (google text to speech) library to convert identified object into audio format.
